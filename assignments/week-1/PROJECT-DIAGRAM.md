## Summary
A pen-shaped battery-powered device that uses data acquired from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to draw objects or write freehand in the air. The data is processed on board and sent via BLE to an output device (display) for rendering. The device uses buttons to start and stop drawing/writing. An EEPROM, BLE, buttons, battery, LEDs and IMU module are needed to build the device.
